title: Server Types

Nova makes it really easy to change what server you are running on.

By default, we support 8 different server JARs:

<Callout type="info">
  By default, the server type is set to SpigotMC.
</Callout>

You can also use a custom JAR, which is shown in the next page.

You can change the server type by using the `serverType` method as such:

```groovy tab="Groovy DSL"
runServer {
    minecraftVersion("1.21.4")
    serverType(ServerType.PAPERMC)
}
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin DSL"
runServer {
    minecraftVersion("1.21.4")
    serverType(ServerType.PAPERMC)
}
```
