# Getting value

You are able to get the original skin:

```java tab="Java"
Skin original = PlayerMetaUtil.getOriginalPlayerSkin(player);
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val original = player.getOriginalSkin()
```

You can also get the current skin:

```java tab="Java"
Skin current = PlayerMetaUtil.getSkin(player);
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val current = player.getSkin()
```

You can also check if the player has a modified skin:

```java tab="Java"
boolean isModified = PlayerMetaUtil.isSkinModified(player);
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val isModified = player.isSkinModified()
```

# Modify value

Lastly you are able to change the player skin.

The first method of doing this is by creating a new `Skin` Instance:

```java tab="Java"
Skin skin = new Skin("texture", "signature");
PlayerMetaUtil.setSkin(player, skin);
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val skin = Skin("texture", "signature")
player.setSkin(skin)
```

Second method is by setting the `texture` and `signature` inside the method:

```java tab="Java"
PlayerMetaUtil.setSkin(player, "texture", "signature");
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
player.setSkin("texture", "signature")
```

Let's use the hypixel's `texture` and `signature`:

# Reset

Lastly you are able to reset the players skin back to the original:

```java tab="Java"
PlayerMetaUtil.resetSkin(player);
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
player.resetSkin()
```
