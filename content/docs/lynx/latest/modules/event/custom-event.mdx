title: Custom Events
---

With Lynx we make it easy and simple to create custom events. We will be explaining this as an example.

# Creating Event

We will be creating `GameStateChangeEvent`.

We will start by creating a class and extend `LynxEvent`:

```java tab="Java"
public class GameStateChangeEvent extends LynxEvent {

}
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
class GameStateChangeEvent(): LynxEvent() {

}
```

Next we add the event values. We will be adding `oldState` and `newState`:

```java tab="Java"
public class GameStateChangeEvent extends LynxEvent {

    private final GameState oldState;
    private final GameState newState;

    public GameStateChangeEvent(GameState oldState, GameState newState) {
        this.oldState = oldState;
        this.newState = newState;
    }

    public GameState getOldState() {
        return oldState;
    }

    public GameState getNewState() {
        return newState;
    }

}
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
class GameStateChangeEvent(
    val oldState: GameState,
    val newState: GameState
): LynxEvent() {}
```

Now we have the custom event.

# Calling Events

Now that we have a custom event we will need to call it.
This can be done by creating a new instance of the event:

```java tab="Java"
GameStateChangeEvent event = new GameStateChangeEvent(GameState.LOADING, GameState.STARTING);
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val event = GameStateChangeEvent(GameState.LOADING, GameState.STARTING)
```

When we have a new instance of the event we call it:

<Tabs items={["Java", "Kotlin"]}>
    <Tab value="Java">

        Calling events in Java we call the static method `LynxEventUtil.call(Event)`:

        ```java
        GameStateChangeEvent event = new GameStateChangeEvent(GameState.LOADING, GameState.STARTING)
        LynxEventUtil.call(event);
        ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Kotlin">
        Calling events in Kotlin we call the `Event.call()`:

        ```kotlin
        val event = GameStateChangeEvent(GameState.LOADING, GameState.STARTING)
        event.call()
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
