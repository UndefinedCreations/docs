title: Listening to events
---

Lynx makes it easy to listen to Bukkit events. Even though it's simple, it still allows for all the customization of normal events.

        When listening to events in Java you will need to call the static method `Events.event()`. Inside the constructor of this method you can customise the event:


        ```java tab="Simple"
        Events.event(PlayerJoinEvent.class, event -> {
            event.setJoinMessage("Fun Custom Join Message");
        });
        ```
        ```kotlin tab="Customisable"
        Events.event(PlayerJoinEvent.class, event -> {
            event.setJoinMessage("Fun Custom Join Message");
        }, EventPriority.HIGH, true);
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Kotlin">
        When listening to events in Kotlin you can call the static method `event<T: Event>()`. Inside the constructor of this method you can customise the event:

        ```kotlin tab="Simple"
        event<PlayerJoinEvent> {
            joinMessage = "Fun Custom Join Message"
        }
        ```
        ```kotlin tab="Customisable"
        event<PlayerJoinEvent>(
            priority = EventPriority.HIGH,
            ignoreCancelled = true
        ) {
            joinMessage = "Fun Custom Join Message"
        }
        ```
