# Height

Interaction entities allow you to modify the height. We can modify this by using `.setHeight(float)`:

```java tab="Java"
Interaction interaction = new Interaction(spawnLocation);
interaction.setHeight(2f);
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val interacation = Interaction(spawnLocation)
interaction.setHeight(2f)
```

# Width

Interaction entities also allow you to modify the width. We can modify this by using `.setWidth(float)`:

```java tab="Java"
Interaction interaction = new Interaction(spawnLocation);
interaction.setWidth(2f);
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin"
val interacation = Interaction(spawnLocation)
interaction.setWidth(2f)
```
