import LatestVersion from "@/app/components/latest-version"

## Installation

To use Echo in your project, we'll first need to add the plugin to your Gradle project.
You can easily add the Echo plugin by adding it to your `plugins` block.

<LatestVersion groupId="com.undefinedcreations" artifactId="echo" host="gradle" />

```groovy tab="Groovy DSL"
id 'com.undefinedcreations.echo' version 'LASTEST-VERSION'
```
```kts tab="Kotlin DSL"
id("com.undefinedcreations.echo") version "LASTEST-VERSION"
```

## Usage

Once the plugin is added, you can start using Echo in your project. You can do two things with Echo:

1. **Access Server Internals**: Echo will automatically download, and import that server JAR using BuildTools.
2. **Remap Server JAR**: The remap task will remap any code into either Mojang, Spigot or obfuscated mappings.
