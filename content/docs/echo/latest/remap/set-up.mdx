title: Set up
---

When using `Mojang` mapped NMS you will likely need to remap it into `Spigot` mappings when running a SpigotMC server for example which is why the `remap` task exists.

The `remap` task will remap any code into either `mojang`, `spigot` or `obfuscated` mappings.

For the task to function, the `minecraftVersion` needs to be set, which can be done by configuring the task:

<Callout type="info">
  If you are already using the Echo to access server internals, this setup is not required as it will automatically use the Minecraft version used there.
</Callout>

```groovy tab="Groovy DSL"
tasks {
    remap {
        minecraftVersion("1.21.4")
    }
}
```
```kotlin tab="Kotlin DSL"
tasks {
    remap {
        minecraftVersion("1.21.4")
    }
}
```
